This work develops algorithms for high-dimensional stochastic optimal control, exploring connections between flow matching, score-based models, mean field games, and control theory. The project involves implementing and comparing multiple SOC solvers including adjoint matching, finite element methods, neural ODEs, and neural-FBSDE solvers.
